# What is CISPR?

{% hint style="info" %}
**About CISPR (Cat Identification System - Pedigreeds and Registrations):** A very convenient and efficient online Identification System for Cat lovers, based on the blockchain technology.
{% endhint %}

CISPR is a decentralized Pet Identification platform for Cats based on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) technology and Smart Contracts.&#x20;

CISPR is a convenient, decentralized platform for genetic registry of pedigreed and domestic cats, the largest registry of household pet cats and kittens. CISPR was the first and now the world's largest registry to allow household cats of unknown ancestry to compete for the same titles and awards as pedigreed cats, using Blockchain Identity Management technology. The knowledgable breeding of pedigreed cats preserves the distinct characteristics of individual pedigreed breeds and ensures the continuation of predictable physical and behavioral traits for future generations.

Smart Contracts and Blockchains are at the core of CISPR. As the network grows, CIS will stop being the only player in the ecosystem and new Requesters, Credential Wallets (Wallet), and Validators start entering the system and interacting independently in the marketplace.
